# Widget Clickable Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the home widget to make activity items clickable, allowing users to open friend's Spotify profiles directly from the widget.

## Changes Made

### 1. Android Widget Improvements

#### `PlaytivityWidgetProvider.kt`
- **Added `userId` field** to `ActivityItem` data class to store friend's user ID
- **Updated data loading** to include user IDs from SharedPreferences
- **Implemented click template** using `setPendingIntentTemplate` for ListView items
- **Added fill-in intents** for individual activity items with user ID and friend name
- **Made entire activity item clickable** by adding click handler to the root layout

#### `widget_activity_item.xml`
- **Added ID and clickable attributes** to the root LinearLayout
- **Enabled focus and click handling** for better touch feedback

#### `MainActivity.kt`
- **Added intent handling** for "OPEN_FRIEND_PROFILE" action in `onNewIntent` and `onResume`
- **Implemented `openSpotifyProfile` method** to launch friend profiles via:
  - Spotify app URI (`spotify:user:{userId}`) 
  - Web fallback (`https://open.spotify.com/user/{userId}`)
- **Added method channel support** for `openFriendProfile` calls from Flutter

### 2. iOS Widget Improvements

#### `PlaytivityWidget.swift`
- **Wrapped activity items in `Link` components** to enable tapping
- **Added fallback for invalid URLs** to maintain non-clickable display
- **Used `spotify:user:{userId}` URLs** for direct Spotify profile access

#### `WidgetDataProvider.swift`
- **Added `userId` field** to `FriendActivity` struct
- **Updated data loading** to read user IDs from UserDefaults
- **Updated preview data** with sample user IDs

### 3. Flutter Integration

#### `friend_profile_launcher.dart` (New File)
- **Created unified profile launcher** for both widget and app usage
- **Dual approach**: Native Android method + direct URL launcher fallback
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging
- **Cross-platform support** for opening Spotify profiles

#### `activity_card.dart`
- **Updated existing clickable elements** to use new `FriendProfileLauncher`
- **Maintained consistency** between app and widget behavior
- **Enhanced user experience** with unified profile opening

#### `widget_service.dart`
- **Already saving user IDs** - no changes needed
- **Existing data structure** supports the new functionality

## How It Works

### Widget Click Flow (Android)
1. User taps on activity item in widget
2. Fill-in intent contains `friendUserId` and `friendName` 
3. MainActivity receives intent with action "OPEN_FRIEND_PROFILE"
4. `openSpotifyProfile` method tries Spotify app first, then web fallback
5. Friend's profile opens in Spotify or browser

### Widget Click Flow (iOS)
1. User taps on activity item in widget
2. `Link` component with `spotify:user:{userId}` URL is activated
3. iOS handles the URL scheme routing
4. Spotify app or web browser opens friend's profile

### App Click Flow (Flutter)
1. User taps friend name/avatar in activity card
2. `FriendProfileLauncher.openFriendProfile` is called
3. Method tries native Android channel first, then direct URL launch
4. Friend's profile opens via best available method

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Widget now provides same clickable functionality as main app
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS widgets
3. **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple fallback methods ensure profiles always open
4. **Consistent UX**: Same behavior across widget and app
5. **Performance**: Efficient click handling without rebuilding widget
6. **User Engagement**: Quick access to friend profiles increases app utility

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Flutter Activity Data → Widget Service → SharedPreferences → Native Widget → Click Handler → Spotify Profile
```

### Error Handling
- Invalid user IDs are handled gracefully
- Missing Spotify app falls back to web browser
- Network issues are logged but don't crash the widget
- Malformed URLs show non-clickable fallback on iOS

### Testing
- Clickable functionality works with existing widget data
- No additional Flutter changes needed for basic functionality
- Compatible with existing widget update mechanisms
- User IDs are already being saved and retrieved correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Track/Content Clicking**: Make track/playlist content clickable in widget
2. **Deep Linking**: Add custom app deep links for friend profiles
3. **Analytics**: Track widget click engagement
4. **Customization**: Allow users to configure click behavior
5. **Visual Feedback**: Add press states to widget items
