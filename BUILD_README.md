After testing a nightly build and confirming it's stable, you can promote it to an official release:

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This feature converts a tested nightly build into a production release!**

### Node.js
```bash
# Promote latest nightly to release (patch increment)
node nightly-release.js

# Promote with version increment type
node nightly-release.js patch     # 0.0.1-nightly-... → 0.0.2+1
node nightly-release.js minor     # 0.1.0-nightly-... → 0.2.0+1
node nightly-release.js major     # 1.0.0-nightly-... → 2.0.0+1

# Promote specific nightly build
node nightly-release.js --build-id 20250614-143022

# Custom version for release
node nightly-release.js --version 1.5.0
```

### NPM Scripts
```bash
npm run nightly:promote              # Promote latest (patch increment)
npm run nightly:promote-patch        # Patch increment
npm run nightly:promote-minor        # Minor increment
npm run nightly:promote-major        # Major increment
```

### PowerShell
```powershell
.\nightly-release.ps1                    # Promote latest (patch increment)
.\nightly-release.ps1 patch             # Patch increment
.\nightly-release.ps1 minor             # Minor increment
.\nightly-release.ps1 major             # Major increment
.\nightly-release.ps1 -BuildId "20250614-143022"  # Specific build
.\nightly-release.ps1 -Version "1.5.0"  # Custom version
```

### Promotion Process
1. **Lists Available Nightly Builds**: Shows all nightly builds with creation dates and sizes
2. **Selects Build**: Uses latest by default, or specify with `--build-id`
3. **Creates Release Version**: Strips `-nightly-` suffix and increments version
4. **Updates pubspec.yaml**: Sets new release version
5. **Builds Signed APK + AAB**: Creates production-ready files with release keystore
6. **Generates Release Notes**: Includes original nightly build info and git details
7. **Stores in releases/**: Organized alongside other official releases

### Example Promotion
```bash
# Before: 0.1.0-nightly-20250614-143022+1718373622
# After:  0.1.1+1 (official release)
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow Examples

### Standard Development Cycle
```bash
# 1. Quick testing during development
npm run build                    # Create development builds for testing

```

### Nightly Release Promotion
When you promote a nightly build using `nightly-release.js`, it:
1. **Reads nightly build metadata** from `nightly/` folder
2. **Creates official release** in `releases/` folder with proper versioning
3. **Strips nightly branding** and creates production-ready APK + AAB
4. **Preserves git history** from original nightly build in release notes
5. **Updates pubspec.yaml** with new release version
├── nightly-info-20250614-143022.json                  # Build metadata
├── nightly-notes-20250614-143022.md                   # Build documentation
├── playtivity-latest-nightly.apk                      # Latest nightly build
├── latest-nightly-info.json                           # Latest build info
└── latest-nightly-notes.md                            # Latest build notes
```

## 🔐 Release Signing Setup

Release builds require a keystore for signing. The scripts handle this automatically:

### Automatic Setup
1. **Base64 Keystore**: If `keystore.base64.txt` exists, it's decoded to `release-key.jks`
2. **Existing Keystore**: If `release-key.jks` exists, it's used directly
3. **Environment Variables**: Credentials can be set via environment variables

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
set ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_password
set ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
set ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password

# PowerShell
$env:ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="your_password"
$env:ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS="your_alias"
$env:ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD="your_key_password"
```

### Default Credentials
If no environment variables are set, defaults are used:
- **Keystore Password**: `playtivity123`
- **Key Alias**: `playtivity-key`
- **Key Password**: `playtivity123`

## 📱 Installing on Device

## 🎯 Why Auto-Increment Version?

Android requires a higher version code (build number) for app updates. These scripts ensure:
- ✅ No version conflicts when installing on device
- ✅ Proper app updates (Android won't install lower version codes)
- ✅ Easy tracking of builds with timestamps
- ✅ Consistent versioning across development team

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Flutter not found"
- Ensure Flutter SDK is in your PATH
- Or install and use FVM: `dart pub global activate fvm`

### "Build failed"
- Check that you're in the project root directory
- Ensure `pubspec.yaml` exists
- Run `flutter doctor` to check Flutter installation

### "Permission denied" (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Allow script execution (run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### "APK won't install on device"
- Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings
- Uninstall previous version if downgrading
- Check available storage space

### "No nightly builds found" (Nightly Promotion)
- Run `npm run nightly` first to create nightly builds
- Check that `nightly/` folder exists with APK files
- Verify nightly build completed successfully

### "Keystore not found" (Release/Nightly Promotion)
- Ensure `release-key.jks` exists in project root
- Or provide `keystore.base64.txt` for automatic keystore setup
- Check keystore permissions and file integrity

### "GitHub CLI not found" (GitHub Release)
- Install GitHub CLI from https://cli.github.com/
- Or install with: `winget install GitHub.cli`
- Ensure `gh` is in your PATH after installation
- Authenticate with: `gh auth login`

### "GitHub CLI not authenticated" (GitHub Release)
- Run `gh auth login` to authenticate
- Follow the prompts to authenticate via web browser
- Verify authentication with: `gh auth status`

### "Permission denied" (GitHub Release)
- Verify you have write access to the repository
- Check that you're the owner or have collaborator access
- Ensure the repository exists and is accessible
- Re-authenticate with: `gh auth login`

## 📝 Notes

- Version increments are permanent (modifies `pubspec.yaml`)
- Build artifacts are stored in `builds/` directory
- Release artifacts are stored in `releases/` directory  
- Nightly artifacts are stored in `nightly/` directory
- Scripts automatically detect and use FVM if available
- Tests run but don't fail the build (continues on error)
- Each build creates both timestamped and "latest" APK files
- Nightly release promotion preserves original build metadata
- Keystore setup is automatic if `keystore.base64.txt` exists
- All scripts are Node.js-based for cross-platform compatibility
- GitHub releases require GitHub CLI authentication
- GitHub releases are marked as prerelease by default (use `--stable` to override)
