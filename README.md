## How It Works

### Friend Activities
The app uses an innovative approach to show friend activities without requiring your own Spotify API credentials:

1. **Direct Web Authentication**: Uses Spotify's web login flow directly without requiring API registration
2. **Automatic Cookie Extraction**: During the login process, the app automatically extracts the `sp_dc` cookie from the WebView
3. **Internal API Access**: Uses the extracted cookie to generate access tokens for Spotify's internal buddy list API
4. **Real-time Data**: Accesses the same endpoints used by Spotify's web player for friend activities

### Technical Implementation
- **TOTP Generation**: Implements the same TOTP algorithm used by Spotify's internal systems
- **Token Generation**: Automatically generates access tokens using the `sp_dc` cookie and TOTP
- **API Integration**: Calls the same endpoints used by Spotify's web player for friend activities

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd playtivity
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

The `scripts/` folder contains utility scripts for development:

### Icon & Image Generator
Automatically generates all required app icons and images from a single source image:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate icons from your image (run from project root)
python scripts/convert_icon.py your_logo.svg
python scripts/convert_icon.py your_logo.png
```

**What it creates:**
- üì± **Android Icons**: All mipmap densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- üñºÔ∏è **Flutter Images**: Login screen logos, button icons, display images
- üé® **Multiple Sizes**: 24x24 to 200x200 pixels for different use cases

See `scripts/README.md` for detailed usage instructions.

## Dependencies

- `provider` - State management
- `http` - API requests  
- `shared_preferences` - Local storage
- `webview_flutter` - Embedded OAuth login
- `cached_network_image` - Image caching
- `timeago` - Time formatting
- `font_awesome_flutter` - Spotify icons
- `crypto` - HMAC-SHA1 for TOTP generation

## Architecture

- **Providers**: State management for authentication and Spotify data
- **Services**: API integration for Spotify Web API and buddy list
- **Models**: Data structures for User, Track, and Activity
- **Screens**: Login, Home (activities), Profile, and Settings
- **Widgets**: Reusable components for activities and tracks

## Current Status

‚úÖ OAuth authentication with automatic cookie extraction  
‚úÖ Real friend activities via unofficial API  
‚úÖ Profile data (currently playing, top tracks/artists)  
‚úÖ Dark mode toggle

## üß™ Testing Status

- **Android**: ‚úÖ Fully tested on Android 15
- **iOS**: ‚ùå Not tested - community contributions welcome!

> **Note**: This app has only been tested on Android 15. While it's built with Flutter and should theoretically work on iOS, no testing has been performed on iOS devices. iOS users may encounter platform-specific issues. We welcome iOS testers and contributors!

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Future improvements planned:

- [‚úÖ] **Complete API-free implementation** - Remove all dependencies on Spotify API client/secret
- [ ] **iOS testing and support** - Test and fix iOS-specific issues
- [ ] **Home screen widgets** - Android widgets showing friend activity and currently playing
